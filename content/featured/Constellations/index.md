The Constellations Project is a community-based participatory research program where the community is comprised of researchers interested in racial health equity. Our aims are to 1) provide a data-based analysis of structural racism in public health scholarship, 2) provide easily digestible data on research collaborations to the public, and 3) foster dialogue about health equity in research.
