In response to the outbreak of mpox among queer and trans people around the world, I initiated an effort with New York-based activists and researchers called the Rapid Epidemiologic Study of Prevalence, Network, and Demographics of Mpox Infection (RESPND-MI). RESPND-MI conducted MPX NYC - an anonymous, online survey that collected information of the social and spatial networks connecting queer and trans people in New York City.
