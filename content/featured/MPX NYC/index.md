In response to the outbreak of MPOX among queer and trans people around the world, I led an effort by New York-based activists and researchers to conduct the Rapid Epidemiologic Study of Prevalence, Network, and Demographics of MPOX Infection (RESPND-MI). This is a LGBTQ+ community-led survey of MPOX symptoms and networks among queer and trans people in New York City.
